Alignment has 800 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 34.46%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 100 non-parametric bootstrap inferences

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
ML estimate of 25 per site rate categories
