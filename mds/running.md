# Running physcraper

You can run `physcraper` directly from the terminal or using a Jupyter notebook.

You can find instructions on how to set this up in the section [installing physcraper](INSTALL.md).


The easist way to start a physcraper run is using a tree uploaded to the Open Tree of Life Project,  
and a single gene alignment for those taxa.

There is an example of a physcraper run in docs/examples/data_scrape.py

Default physcraper runs use the OpenTree and NCBI web services, and are slow.
