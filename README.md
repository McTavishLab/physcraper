## Continual gene tree updating!

Use a tree (from the literature, a synthetic tree from Open Tree of Life, or your own tree) and a single locus alignment to find and add homologous sequences to (hopefully) improve and advance phylogenetic inference in a group.


The tool is under current development in the McTavish Lab.
Please contact ejmctavish@gmail if you need any help or have feedback.

This is the code repository, please refer to Physcraper's [documentation website](https://physcraper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details on how to install it and run!
