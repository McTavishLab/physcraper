Code testing the major functionalities of Physcraper can be found in [test](../../tests/) and [ws-tests](../../ws-tests/).

To run these tests locally (in your own computer), do


```
sh tests/run_test.sh
sh ws-tests/run_ws-tests.sh`.
```

If you want to see each step of the Physcraper algorithm in action, you can also
run part of the tests in a python session.

For example, you can do:

```
python test/test_multi.py
```
